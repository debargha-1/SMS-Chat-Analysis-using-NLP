# SMS Chat Analysis with NLP

## üìú Overview
This project explores automated chat analysis using the [UCI SMS Spam Collection dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection). By applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the system extracts valuable insights such as detecting spam, understanding sentiments, and summarizing key points from SMS data.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing SMS text for analysis.
- **Spam Detection**: Binary classification to identify spam and non-spam messages.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the tone and sentiment of text messages.
- **Intention Classification**: Categorizing messages based on purpose.
- **Summarization**: Extracting concise insights from conversations.
- **Visualizations**: Charts and graphs for data insights.

## üìÇ Dataset
The project uses the [SMS Spam Collection dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection), which contains labeled SMS messages classified as "ham" (not spam) or "spam." This dataset is ideal for text classification and NLP experiments.
